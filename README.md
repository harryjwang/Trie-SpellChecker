# Trie-SpellChecker
This project is a spell-checking system implemented in C++ using a trie-based dictionary. The trie enables extremely fast insertions, searches, and prefix lookups, making it well-suited for large word corpora. Input text is parsed token by token, with each word checked against the trie to detect spelling errors or confirm validity.

The project also explores how prefix queries enable auto-suggestion functionality, providing possible corrections when a word is not found. The program is designed to scale with large dictionaries and long input files, emphasizing efficient memory management and low-latency lookups.

Beyond its technical utility, the project illustrates how abstract data structures such as tries can be applied to practical applications like natural language processing, search engines, and auto-complete systems. It reflects both the efficiency benefits and the design complexity of balancing memory usage against query speed.
